## Set up the data frame for the 2017 and 2016 SONA speeches

I've used the freely availble speech text from www.gov.za/speeches, printed it as a pdf and then converted it to text using the package **pdftools**. 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(pdftools)
library(tm)
library(dplyr)
library(tidytext)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(scales)

files <- list.files(path = "~/R/SONATextMining/Data_raw",
                    pattern = "pdf$", 
                    full.names = TRUE)

addresses <- lapply(files, pdf_text)
addresses_clean <- lapply(addresses, removeNumbers)



```
The first step in the analysis is to convert the lines of text into a tidy data frame of only words. I have used the **tidytext** package and the **unnest_tokens** function to do so. I further removed stop words and created a word count which will be used to create a graph of the most common words.
```{r convertToTokens, echo = FALSE}
text1_df <- data_frame(page = 1:17, text = addresses_clean[[2]])

tidySONA17 <- text1_df %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

text2_df <- data_frame(page = 1:15, text = addresses_clean[[1]])

tidySONA16 <- text2_df %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```
```{r commonWordPlot, echo = FALSE}
tidySONA17 %>% 
  filter(n > 10) %>% 
  mutate(word = reorder(word,n)) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(word, n)
  ) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab(NULL) + 
  coord_flip()

tidySONA16 %>% 
  filter(n > 10) %>% 
  mutate(word = reorder(word,n)) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(word, n)
  ) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab(NULL) + 
  coord_flip()
```


Next let us check for common words between the two speeches:

```{r compareSpeeches}
SONA17_percent <- tidySONA17 %>% 
  #mutate(word = str_extract(word, "[a-z']+")) %>% 
  transmute(word, sona17 = n / sum(n))

frequency <- tidySONA16 %>% 
  #mutate(word = str_extract(word, "[a-z']+")) %>% 
  transmute(word, sona16 = n / sum(n)) %>%
  left_join(SONA17_percent) %>% 
  ungroup()

ggplot(frequency, 
       aes(x = sona16, 
           y = sona17, 
           color = abs(sona17 - sona16)
           )
       ) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1, 
              size = 2.5, 
              width = 0.3, 
              height = 0.3
              ) +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = word),
    check_overlap = TRUE,
    vjust = 1.5
    ) +
  scale_x_log10(
    labels = percent_format()
    ) +
  scale_y_log10(
    labels = percent_format()
    ) +
  scale_color_gradient(
    limits = c(0, 0.001), 
    low = "darkslategray4", 
    high = "gray75"
    ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y = "SONA17", x = "SONA16")
  
  
```


How correlated are these two speeches? We see a 95% confidence interval of 0.72 to 0.79 for the correlation with a sample estimate of 0.76 (rounded to two decimal points). It certainly makes sense that speeches by the same president, only a  year apart, would share a lot of the same content.

```{r}
cor.test(data = frequency, 
         ~ sona16 + sona17)
```

On to some sentiment analysis

```{r}
nrc <- get_sentiments("nrc")

sentimentSONA17 <- tidySONA17 %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>% 
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup()
  

 sentimentSONA16 <- tidySONA16 %>% 
  inner_join(nrc)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
